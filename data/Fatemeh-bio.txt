I'm a research scientist at Monash University in Australia, working with A/Prof. Yuan-Fang Li and Prof. Reza Haffari in the Vision and Language discipline group.
I was a Sessional Lecturer and Research Fellow at Deakin University before commencing at Monash University. I obtained my PhD in Computer Science from the Australian National University and Data61-CSIRO</a> in 2020, under the supervision of Prof. Richard Hartley and Prof. Fatih Porikli, and Dr. Piotr Konisuz. 	My research interests lie at the intersection of natural language processing, computer vision, and deep learning. Currently, my research aims to leverage Generative AI models for multimodal information extraction and knowledge base construction.
